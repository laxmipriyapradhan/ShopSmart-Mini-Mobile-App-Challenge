## 🧠 Why I Chose These Libraries

| Library | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **React Native CLI** | Full native control as per challenge guidelines |
| **Redux Toolkit** | Clean, scalable global state management (cart/profile) |
| **Redux Persist** | Maintains state across app restarts |
| **Axios** | For simple and reliable API communication |
| **React Navigation** | Most stable and widely adopted navigation library |
| **React Native Image Picker** | For selecting and uploading profile pictures |



## ⚖️ Trade-offs & Shortcuts

- Focused more on functionality than UI polish due to time constraints.
- Profile form is local-only, no backend sync.
- Image upload is mock (no actual storage).
- Styling is a mix of inline and `StyleSheet.create` for quick setup.
